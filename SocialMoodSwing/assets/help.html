			<h3>Keyword Selection Tips</h3>
			The performance of this application is highly dependent on keywords that you choose.
			The following tips may be helpful in selecting keywords for various topics:
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure that your keywords are spelled correctly (keywords are not case sensitive).</li>
				<li>For Example: The Keyword "Twitter":
					<ul>
					<li>will match any of the following: TWITTER, twitter, "Twitter", twitter., #twitter, @twitter, or http://twitter.com</li>
					<li>but it will not match: TwitterTracker or #newtwitter</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do not choose keywords that are vague or not specific to the topic, as this may cause the application to gather irrelevant Tweets.</li>
				<li>Do not choose keywords with built-in bias. Choosing keywords that are negatively/positively associated with the topic to begin with may bias your results.</li>
				<li>A single keyword field may contain multiple words.</li>
			</ul>
