			<strong>Keyword Selection Tips:</strong></br>
			The performance of this application is highly dependent on keywords that you choose.
			The following tips may be helpful in selecting keywords for various topics:
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure that your keywords are spelled correctly (keywords are not case sensitive).</li>
				<li>Do not choose keywords that are vague or not specific to the topic, as this may cause the application to gather irrelevant Tweets.</li>
				<li>Do not choose keywords with built-in bias. Choosing keywords that are negatively/positively associated with the topic to begin with may bias your results.</li>
