CS480 Twitter Social Media Mood App for Android

This purpose of this project is to develop an automated way of gauging the mood of any topic based on social media, specifically Twitter, using a portable Android device. The software should determine the sentiment of the Twitter community with respect to a given topic, without looking at traditional news sources. The project is part of the coursework for CS480 (Senior Design I) at the University of Idaho.
